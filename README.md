<b>Deterministic Finite Automaton (DFA)</b></br>
In DFA, for each input symbol, one can determine the state to which the machine will move. Hence, it is called Deterministic Automaton. As it has a finite number of states, the machine is called Deterministic Finite Machine or Deterministic Finite Automaton.

A DFA can be represented by a 5-tuple (Q, ∑, δ, q0, F) where −

Q is a finite set of states.

∑ is a finite set of symbols called the alphabet.

δ is the transition function where δ: Q × ∑ → Q

q0 is the initial state from where any input is processed (q0 ∈ Q).

F is a set of final state/states of Q (F ⊆ Q).
